# C++ RoutePlanningProject
This is the first project in nanodegree Program from [udacity](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project). A* search algorithms is implemented to calculate and draw the shortest distance between start and end points(Here is an simple example of A* search algorithm [example](https://github.com/Kindiras/Udacity_Advanced_CPlusPlus/blob/main/A*SearchPathFinding/PathFinding.cpp)). The user enters start point and end point as x and y coordinates, then the map is drawn  using IO2D visualization library to build a route planner that finds a path between two points on a real-world map.

All the installation and compiling instruction are available in above udacity link.
